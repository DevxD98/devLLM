# Benchmark 002 — KV Cache (Optimization C1)

| Field | Value |

| Type | optimization |
| Baseline | `benchmarks/001_baseline.md` |

## 1. What & why
Implementation of KV caching for autoregressive generation (`src/jimmylabs/inference/generate.py` and `attention.py`). By caching the Key and Value tensors for previously generated tokens, we drop the computational complexity of generating the $N$th token from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$, avoiding redundant recalculation of past attention scores.

## 2. Machine state
- Mac / chip: MacBook Air M1
- macOS: **26.5.2** (arm64)
- Python / PyTorch: **torch 2.13.0**
- Device: **mps** · dtype: **fp32**
- Protocol: warmup=10 discarded, **median of 50**, `torch.mps.synchronize()` around each timed region

## 3. Configuration
- Model: L=4, h=4, C=128, block=128 → **818,048 params** (v0.1, `configs/train_shakespeare.yaml`)
- Batch size: 16 · sequence length: 128
- Generation: 200 new tokens from a 1-token prompt, using `--use_cache`

## 4. Results (median, warm — same-session naive vs cache)

Measured back-to-back with `scripts/benchmark.py` (3 runs each, all warm). We compare naive
vs cache **in the same session** rather than against 001, because 001's naive figure
(103 tok/s) was taken in a cooler thermal state; a same-session A/B is the honest delta
(docs/14).

| Metric | naive (`--use_cache` off) | KV cache (`--use_cache`) | Delta |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| **Generate throughput** | ~83 tok/s (81/84/85) | **~137 tok/s (137/138/137)** | **+65%** |
| **Train throughput** | 64,944 tok/s | 64,944 tok/s | unaffected (cache is inference-only) |

Correctness gate: `tests/test_kv_cache.py::test_kv_cache_equivalence` asserts the cached
output is **bit-identical** to the naive path (`torch.equal`, temp=0) — the optimization
changes speed, not results.

## 5. Interpretation
- **Speedup is real and stable**: ~+65% generation throughput (naive ~83 → cache ~137
  tok/s), reproducible across runs. KV caching avoids recomputing keys/values for past
  tokens, so per-step work drops from $O(T)$ toward $O(1)$ (overall generation $O(T^2) \to
  O(T)$). At this tiny `block_size=128` the constant Python-loop overhead still caps the
  win; at larger context the gap widens sharply.
- **Correctness first**: the win only counts because the equivalence test proves cached ==
  naive output. A faster generator that changed the text would be a regression, not an
  optimization.
- **Note on the prior draft**: an earlier version of this record reported +25% (103→129);
  those figures predated a fix to `scripts/benchmark.py` (a missing `contextlib` import made
  it crash) and were not script-measured. The numbers above are measured with the fixed
  harness and reproduce.

## 6. Reproduce
```bash
python scripts/benchmark.py --use_cache
```
