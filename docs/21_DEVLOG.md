## Purpose

The Devlog is a chronological record of major project milestones, architectural decisions, and lab notes. It records *how* JimmyLabs evolved from initial design scaffolds to a working 1–4M parameter model.

## Chronological Entries

### 2026-07-25 — Phases 0–3 Code + First Coherent Text (v0.1 milestone) 🎉
- **Milestone:** JimmyLabs trains end-to-end and generates recognizable Shakespeare.
  Validation loss fell **4.174 → 1.54** over 5000 steps on the M1 (MPS).
- **Code shipped:** autograd toy + XOR + MNIST (Phase 0); character tokenizer + data
  loader (Phase 1); the GPT model — `config`, `embedding`, `attention`, `feedforward`,
  `block`, `gpt` (Phase 2); training loop, warmup→cosine LR schedule, checkpointing, and
  autoregressive generation (Phase 3). **39 tests green**; CI added
  (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`).
- **Result:** first trained sample in
  [`outputs/trained_shakespeare_sample.txt`](../outputs/trained_shakespeare_sample.txt) —
  real character names and the `NAME:` play format — versus the pre-training garbage in
  `untrained_baseline.txt`. Exactly the expected quality for a 0.82M char-GPT.
- **Postmortem — the flat-loss bug:** the *first* 5000-step run sat at loss = ln(65) =
  4.174 the whole way; the model learned nothing. Root cause: `train.py` called
  `get_batch('train', …)` — passing a **string** where a data tensor belongs — and a
  `try/except` **silently trained on random tokens** instead of failing. Fix: correct the
  call + **delete the silent fallback** (missing data now errors loudly) + a regression
  test (`test_train_integration.py`).
  **Lesson (now a standing rule): never catch-and-substitute data/inputs — fail loudly.**
  A silent fallback turned a one-line typo into a 5000-step waste, and the end-to-end run
  caught what all 37 unit tests structurally could not.

### 2026-07-24 — Phase 0–4 Core Documentation Completion
- **Milestone:** Completed foundational, model architecture, training, inference, and experiment documentation across `docs/04` through `docs/16`.
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - `docs/04_MATHEMATICS.md`: Established canonical definitions for matrix multiplication and softmax.
  - `docs/05_NEURAL_NETWORKS.md`: Documented the overfit-a-batch golden rule for ML debugging.
  - `docs/06_TOKENIZER.md` & `docs/07_EMBEDDINGS.md`: Tokenization contracts, positional embeddings, and weight tying concepts.
  - `docs/10_GPT_ARCHITECTURE.md`: Decoder-only model assembly matching `SPEC.md` §5 param math.
  - `docs/11_TRAINING_PIPELINE.md` & `docs/12_INFERENCE.md`: Full training optimization loop and autoregressive sampling mechanics.
  - `docs/15_EXPERIMENT_GUIDE.md` & `docs/16_MODEL_CONFIGURATION.md`: Scientific lab method and annotated `configs/model_v0_1_char_100k.yaml`.
- **Architectural Fixes Actioned:**
  - Added `ADR-0002` (Pre-Layer Normalization by Default).
  - Added `ADR-0003` (Weight Tying as v0.1 Default Baseline).
  - Updated `docs/01_ROADMAP.md` and `research/ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` checkboxes.

### 2026-07-24 — Research Platform & Constitution Infrastructure
- **Milestone:** Established repository constitution and specification source of truth.
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - `ENGINEERING_PRINCIPLES.md`: 10 core principles governing performance profiling, reproducibility, and configuration separation.
  - `SPEC.md`: Living technical specification with worked parameter and 8 GB memory arithmetic.
  - `research/ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md`: Comprehensive Staff Engineer architecture review.
  - `research/OPTIMIZATION_BACKLOG.md`: Prioritized backlog for Apple Silicon MPS optimization.

---

### 2026-07-24 — Initial Repository Scaffold
- **Milestone:** Created repository structure, documentation dependency graph, and initial flagship documents (`docs/03`, `docs/08`, `docs/09`).
- **Key Rationale:** Documentation-first architecture—designing and understanding components before writing code.
